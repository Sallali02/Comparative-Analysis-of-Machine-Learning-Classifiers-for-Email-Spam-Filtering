# Comparative-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Classifiers-for-Email-Spam-Filtering
The objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance of various machine learning classifiers for the task of email spam filtering. The objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance of various machine learning classifiers for the task of email spam filtering. I will implement and analyze classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Random Forest Classifier. I will then utilize evaluation metrics suitable for binary classification tasks and compare the classifiers based on their performance.
